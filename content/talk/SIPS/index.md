abstract: The purpose of this workshop is two-fold. We will cover the importance of data visualization, give you small group coding challenges to re-create particular types of visualizations in R, and show how to build a reproducible Binder. For research to be fully reproducible, we need to share our data, our code and the computational environment that allows the code to be re-executed. BinderHub allows us to do just this by creating a computational instant from a GitHub repository using R packages and their dependencies associated with a particular time point. Once you have completed the data visualization coding challenges we will show you how to capture your data, code, and computational environment in a Binder.
