In November and December 2019 I will be delivering my new MSci unit in Reproducible 
Data Science. This unit covers everthing from the basics of data visualisation 
and data wrangling in R, through to the general linear model, mixed models, and 
how to engage in fully reproducible research by using tools such as Binder to 
capture your computational environemnt alongside your data and code. The 
materials for the six workshops that make up this unit can be found here:

If you scroll to the bottom of the page, you can even launch the unit in your
browser using Binder.
