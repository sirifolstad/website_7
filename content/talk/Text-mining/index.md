abstract: In this talk I will introduce text mining in R using the amazing Tidytext package by Julia Silge and David Robinson. We'll cover how to summarise text data, sentiment analysis, the extraction of frequency information (demonstrating Zipf's law), characterising text that plays a unique contribution in two different corpora, N-gram analysis, and scraping Twitter and visualising Tweets. We'll also have a look at the Twitter timelines of Stephen King and Neil Gaiman...
